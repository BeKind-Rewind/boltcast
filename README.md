# boltcast

Using html, javascrip and css I have put together a weather app which will show the current weather forecast of the location of the user's choice. 

I started with vanilla javascript and am looking to refactor to use less code and speed up the loadtime. Also, I would like to update the look of the app with more interesting background images, styling and simply animations while keeping the load speed from getting bogges down.
